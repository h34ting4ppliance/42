# 42

**42 is an advanced program to compute the answer to the ultimate question of life.**

## Why?

Because we all need to know it, I have worked for years to make this program finally usable so everyone can know the answer.

## Installation

Compile the program
```
$ make
```

Install the program
```
# make install
```

Run the program
```
$ 42
```

Run the program as an administrator using `sudo`
```
$ sudo 42
```

If you have `doas`, use this instead
```
$ doas 42
```

If you have none of them, you might want to use this alternative
```
$ su -c "42"
````

Documentation is still a Work in progress because I am lazy.
